Crypto Creams is a new concept for food retail. We sell soya-based protein ice creams for the people of the future. We want to end meat production. We believe our ice cream is the way to reinvent how we bring proteins to humanity and shape our sustainable future.

Crypto Creams is backed by our own cryptocurrency â€“ the Crypto Creams Coin [CCC]. This coin is mined through people taking pictures and proposing potential sites for our outlets. Once an outlet is built on a site, the miners that have proposed it get continuous coin revenue from the sales at that outlet. All sales are done through CCC and each sale mines more coins. A Crypto Cream Factory is the ultimate coin miner and produces coins based on ice cream output.
